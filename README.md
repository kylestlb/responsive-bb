How to build:

`npm install
bower install
npm start`

Project tracking in the README for now because lazy...

Todos:
- "Learn" basics of Express + React
- Wire up simple 'hello world' homepage from front to back 
- Build React components for pieces of discussion board

Decisions:
- Implement Flux architecture?
- Database choice?
- Unit test framework?
- Wiredep for auto-injection of bower components?
- Use NPM to track all deps and then browserify to pack all css and js?
- Grunt/gulp for builds / task running?
